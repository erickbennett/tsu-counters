# tsu-counters

## What is it?
webapp to practice 日本語 つ counters using vanilla JS

## Notes
- I wanted to keep this simple- all vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS and contained in one file so it does not need to be hosted
- props to [yoksel](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/) for her handy util to url encode svg's so I could keep this to one html file
